\section{Constructing the manifold cover}

% The goal now is to show that, if we have a Coxeter group \(W\) and its Tits cone \(WC\), then there is a finite index subgroup \(H \leq W\), such that \(WC/H\) is a manifold.
% For this we will extensively make use of the tools constructed in section \(2.6\).

Consider the abelianization homomorphism \(\alpha : W \to W_{ab} \cong (\Z / 2\Z)^{\vert I \vert}\).
By the first isomorphism theorem, its kernel has finite index in \(W\) as \(\abs{W/\ker \alpha} = \abs{W_{ab}} = 2^{\abs{I}} < \infty\).
