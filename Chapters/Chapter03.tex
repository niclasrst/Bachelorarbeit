\chapter{The main theorem}
%************************************************

Let us quickly recall the main theorem we want to prove.

\begin{theorem*}
    A finitely generated right-angled Coxeter group \(W\) has a finite index subgroup \(W'\) such that \(W'\) is residually finite and rationally solvable (RFRS).
\end{theorem*}

For the following, we consider the Tits cone \(WC\) corresponding to \(W\), living in \(\R^n\) for \(n = \abs{I}\).
Before continuing, we want to shortly mention that the fundamental chamber \(C\) has a natural orbifold structure as the quotient \(\faktor{WC}{W}\). % \(WC/W\).
This will be covered later on in slightly greater detail.
% By the discussion of last chapter, we know that by taking the quotient \(WC/W\), we are left with the fundamental chamber \(C\).
In the first section, our goal is to produce a manifold cover \(C' \to C\) of the fundamental chamber.
This cover will be induced by a finite index subgroup in the right-angled Coxeter group \(W\).


% ***********************************************
\section{Construction of the manifold cover}
% ***********************************************

Consider the abelianization \(W_{\text{ab}}\) of \(W\), which is isomorphic to \((\Z/2\Z)^{n}\).
Now, the abelianization yields a homomorphism \(\alpha : W \to W_{\text{ab}}\) to whose kernel \(\ker\alpha\), we will turn our attention to in the following.
Note that by the first homomorphism theorem, \(\ker\alpha\) has finite index in \(W\), since
\[\abs{\faktor{W}{\ker\alpha}} = \abs{\faktor{\Z}{2\Z}}^{n} = 2^{n} < \infty.\]
Here we used the fact that \(W\) is finitely generated, whence \(n = \abs{I} = \abs{S} < \infty\).

Furthermore, note that for each \(J \subset I\) with \(W_J\) finite, we have an isomorphism between \(W_J\) and \((\faktor{\Z}{2\Z})^{\abs{J}}\).
Thus, the restriction of \(\alpha\) to each such subgroup \(\alpha\vert_{W_J}\) is an injective homomorphism.
We now use that in the right-angled case, the isotropy subgroups of codimension-\(k\) faces are all of this form.
This can be seen, as the isotropy subgroup of a codimension-\(k\) face \(F\) is generated by the reflections in the \(k\) codimension-\(1\) faces, whose intersection forms \(F\).
As all these codimension-\(1\) faces meet at angle \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), the generators commute pairwise.
Therefore, all isotropy subgroups inject into the abelianization of \(W\).
This implies that the intersection of an isotropy subgroup with the kernel of \(\alpha\) is trivial and consequently no isotropy group is contained in the kernel \(\ker\alpha\).
Since finite subgroups are contained in isotropy subgroups, the kernel \(\ker\alpha\) acts freely on the Tits cone \(WC\) corresponding to \(W\).

In particular, by \Cref{thm:stabilizer} the action of \(W\) on the interior of its Tits cone \(int(WC)\) is properly discontinuously.
By \Cref{thm:convexity} the Tits cone is also a convex cone, implying that it has trivial fundamental group, whence is simply-connected.
Having all this information, we are able to apply \Cref{lem:covering} to obtain the covering
\[int(WC) \;\longrightarrow\; \faktor{int(WC)}{\ker\alpha} \qquad x \mapsto \text{Orb}_{\ker\alpha}(x).\]
% Using the local homeomorphism property of a covering map and the fact that the Tits cone \(WC\) is a subspace of \(\R^n\), we conclude that the quotient \(\faktor{int(WC)}{\ker\alpha}\) is indeed a manifold.
We conclude the result of this section in the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}
    Let \(W\) be a right-angled Coxeter group with corresponding Tits cone \(WC\). % and fundamental chamber \(C\).
    Then, there is a finite index subgroup \(W' \leq W\), acting by covering action on the interior of the Tits cone, implying the quotient \(\faktor{int(WC)}{W'}\;\) is a manifold.
    In particular, \(W' = \ker\alpha = \ker\{W \to W_{\text{ab}}\}\).
    % In particular, we can take \(W'\) to be the kernel of the abelianization homomorphism \(\alpha : W \to W_{\text{ab}}\).
\end{proposition}

\section{Some orbifold theory}
% ***********************************************

In this section, we want to elaborate more on the natural orbifold structure of the fundamental chamber \(C\).
We start by giving a formal definition of an orbifold.
We break the definition down into smaller pieces, starting with local models, also called (orbifold) charts.

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{local model} is a pair \((\widetilde{U}, \Gamma)\), where \(\widetilde{U} \subset \R^n\) is open and \(\Gamma\) is a finite subgroup of the group of diffeomorphisms of \(\widetilde{U}\), denoted \emph{diffeo}\((\widetilde{U})\), acting on \(\widetilde{U}\).
    By abusing notation, we will sometimes say that the quotient \(U = \faktor{\widetilde{U}}{\Gamma}\;\) is the local model.
\end{definition}

Now that we defined a local structure of an orbifold, we want to translate between these local models.
This is being made precise by orbifold maps.

\begin{definition}
    An \emph{orbifold map} between local models \((\widetilde{U}_i, \Gamma_i), (\widetilde{U}_j, \Gamma_j)\) is a pair of maps \((\widetilde{\psi}, \varphi)\).
    The map \(\widetilde{\psi} : \widetilde{U}_i \to \widetilde{U}_j\) is smooth and \(\varphi : \Gamma_i \to \Gamma_j\) a homomorphism of groups, such that the map \(\widetilde{\psi}\) is \(\varphi\)-equivariant, meaning that for all \(g \in \Gamma_i\) and all \(\widetilde{x} \in \widetilde{U}_i\), \(\widetilde{\psi}(g\widetilde{x}) = \varphi(g)\widetilde{\psi}(\widetilde{x})\) holds.
    Then \(\widetilde{\psi}\) induces a map \(\psi : \faktor{\widetilde{U}_i}{\Gamma_i} \to \faktor{\widetilde{U}_j}{\Gamma_j}\), between the local models.
    When all three of these maps are injective, we call \(\psi\) a local isomorphism.
\end{definition}

Now that we have these local definitions, we `glue' them together, to obtain an orbifold.
Before we do so, we recall some notions from topology.
Suppose we are given an open cover \(\{U_i\}\) of a topological space \(X\).
An open cover \(\{V_j\}\) of \(X\) is an \emph{refinement} of \(\{U_i\}\), if for every \(U_i\) there is a \(V_j\) with \(V_j \subseteq U_i\).
An open cover \(\{U_i\}\) of \(X\) is \emph{locally finite}, if every \(x \in X\) admits a neighborhood \(N\) such that \(N \cap U_i\) is empty for all but finitely many \(i\).
Now, a topological space \(X\) is \emph{paracompact}, if every open cover of \(X\) admits a locally finite refinement.


\begin{definition}
    An \(n\)-dimensional \emph{(smooth) orbifold} \(Q\) is a pair \((X_Q, \mathcal{A})\).
    The space \(X_Q\) is a paracompact Hausdorff space, called the \emph{underlying space}.
    The set \(\mathcal{A}\) is called an \emph{orbifold atlas}, consisting of charts \((U_i, \phi_i)\), indexed by some set \(I\) and satisfying the following conditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the \(U_i\) form an open cover of the underlying space \(X_Q\),\vspace*{-.7em}
        \item for each \(U_i\) there exists a local model \(\faktor{\widetilde{U}_i}{\Gamma_i}\) with a homeomorphism \(\phi_i : U_i \to \faktor{\widetilde{U}_i}{\Gamma_i}\) and
        \item charts have to be compatible, meaning that for \(U_i \subset U_j\) the inclusion is a local isomorphism.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

To sketch the connection between manifolds and orbifolds, let us mention one more thing.

\begin{definition}
    The \emph{local group} \(loc(x)\) of some \(x\) in a local model \(\faktor{\widetilde{U}}{\Gamma}\;\) is the isotropy group of any \(\widetilde{x}\) in \(\widetilde{U}\), getting projected onto \(x\).
    The \emph{singular locus} \(\Sigma (Q)\) of an orbifold \(Q\) consists of all points in the underlying space \(X_Q\) with non-trivial local group, i.e. \(\Sigma(Q) = \{x \in X_Q \;\vert\; loc(x) \neq \{1\}\}\).
\end{definition}

By this definition, we see that an orbifold with empty singular locus is just a manifold.
Furthermore, when thinking about an orbifold, we can just think about the underlying space and label each element in the singular locus by its local group.

Many basic examples arise by taking the quotient relative to a properly discontinuous group action on \(\R^n\).
We want to mention at least some examples.

\begin{example} % TODO: add pictures
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider the flat plane \(\R^2\) with the action of a cyclic group \(\faktor{\Z}{n\Z}\) by rotation about the origin.
            The arising orbifold is a cone with singular point the origin and cone angle \(\frac{2\pi}{n}\).
        
        \item Consider the round sphere \(S^2\) with the action of a cyclic group \(\faktor{\Z}{2\Z}\) by rotation about the north pole \(N\).
            The arising orbifold now is called a \emph{teardrop} with singular point, the north pole \(N\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

Many orbifolds arise by passing to the quotient \(M/G\) of a properly discontinuous action of a group \(G\) on a topological space \(M\).
This is also the case for the fundamental chamber \(C\), its natural orbifold structure arises by taking the quotient of the Tits cone of \(W\) by its action. % TODO: add picture
From another point of view, the fundamental chamber can also be seen as a quotient of the manifold \(\faktor{WC}{\ker\alpha}\) by a finite group action.

Another concept worth mentioning is the theory of orbifold coverings.

\begin{definition}
    An orbifold covering \(p: Q' \to Q\) is a continuous map on the underlying spaces \(X_{Q'} \to X_Q\), such that for each point \(x \in X_Q\) there is a local model \(U = \faktor{\widetilde{U}}{\Gamma}\) around \(x\) and each component \(V_i\) of \(p^{-1}(U)\) is homeomorphic to \(\faktor{\widetilde{U}}{\Gamma_i}\) for a subgroup \(\Gamma_i\) of \(\Gamma\).
    Furthermore, the restriction \(p\vert_{V_i} : V_i \to U\) corresponds to the natural projection \(\faktor{\widetilde{U}}{\Gamma_i} \to \faktor{\widetilde{U}}{\Gamma}\).
\end{definition}

As one might have noticed, there are many analogies between `ordinary' coverings, orbifold coverings as well as orbifolds and manifolds.
Especially, there is a notion of orbifold fundamnetal groups as well.
The analogy here happens to be that orbifold fundamental groups behave to orbifold coverings as `ordinary' fundamental groups do to `ordinary' coverings as in \Cref{def:covering}.
In particular, there is again a correspondence between subgroups (of index \(n\)) of the orbifold fundamental group and (\(n\)-sheeted) orbifold coverings.
In the case of the fundamental chamber \(C \cong \faktor{WC}{W}\) this implies that the manifold \(\faktor{WC}{\ker\alpha}\), constructed in the last section, is a manifold cover of \(C\).
This is due to the fact that a manifold is an orbifold with trivial singular locus and \(\ker\alpha\) is a finite index subgroup of \(W\).


% ***********************************************
\section{The cofinal cover}
% ***********************************************

In this section, we want to at least \emph{sketch} the proof of the existence of a cofinal sequence of two-fold covers, arising by iteratively reflecting in faces.
Some more results from the theory of orbifolds are needed for the whole proof.
We will state and use them without proof.

The following proposition tells us, that for a right-angled Coxeter group, we are able to `double' the fundamental chamber in one of its faces and are still able to cover the whole Tits cone \(WC\) by reflecting in the faces of the resulting chamber.
By doubling, pictorially, we mean to unfold the fundamental chamber (more generally a polytope) along one of its faces, by reflecting in this face.
The chamber and its double will then be the new chamber of interest.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:double}
    Let \(C \subset \R^n\) be the fundamental chamber of a right-angled Coxeter group \(W\), acting on its Tits cone \(WC\).
    The orbifold fundamental group \(\pi_1^{\text{orb}}(P)\) of the doubled chamber \(P\) is isomorphic to the reflection group generated by reflections in its faces.
    Further, it has index \(2\) in the orbifold fundamental group \(\pi_1^{\text{orb}}(C)\) of \(C\). %, due to the covering theory of orbifolds.
    This procedure can be iterated and the induced group action of \(\pi_1^{\text{orb}}(P)\) by reflections in the faces of the doubled polytope \(P\) on the Tits cone \(WC\) corresponding to \(W\) satisfies the following conditions
    \[g\mathring{P} \cap \mathring{P} \neq \emptyset \implies g = 1 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \underset{g \in \pi_1^{\text{orb}}(P)}{\bigcup} gP = WC.\]
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item \(g\mathring{P} \cap \mathring{P} \neq \emptyset \implies g = 1\),
    %     \item \(\underset{g \in \pi_1^{\text{orb}}(P)}{\bigcup} gP = WC\).
    % \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

To state the other helping lemma we will need, we first want to show that each chamber in the Tits cone can uniquely be labeled by elements of its corresponding group.

\begin{lemma}
    Let \(W\) be a Coxeter group and \(WC\) its Tits cone.
    The chambers of the form \(w(C)\) in the Tits cone can be labeled uniquely by elements in \(W\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(v(C), w(C)\) be chambers in \(WC\) for \(v, w \in W\), such that \(v \neq w\) and \(w(C) = v(C)\).\newline
    But then, by \Cref{thm:stabilizer} we have that
    \[w(\mathring{C}) \cap v(\mathring{C}) = w(\mathring{C} \cap w^{-1}v(\mathring{C})) \neq \emptyset \implies w^{-1}v = 1 \iff w = v.\]
    Thus, the chambers can be labeled in a unique way.
\end{proof}

We proceed with a helpful result, whose proof will be sketched.

\begin{lemma}
    Let \(C \subset \R^n\) be the fundamental chamber of a Coxeter group \(W\).
    The non-trivial labels \(w_i \neq 1_W\) of the chambers, defining the polytope \(P = \bigcup_{i=1}^n w_i C\), are \emph{not} contained in the reflection group, generated by reflecting in its faces.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The idea is to produce a contradiction to \Cref{prop:double}. \newline
    Let \(w_i \neq 1_W\) be one of those labels.
    But then, \(w_i(\mathring{P}) \cap \mathring{P} \neq \emptyset\), contradicting said proposition.
\end{proof}

Using this insight, we define a graph \(G\) with vertices \(V(G) := \{w(C) \;\vert\; w \in W\}\) and edges \(E(G) := W \times S\).
The endpoint map is given by \(\delta : W \times S \to 2^{V(G)},\; (w, s) \mapsto (w(C), ws(C))\).
Thus, two vertices \(w(C)\) and \(v(C)\) have an edge, if there is an \(s \in S\), such that \(ws = v\).
Then, clearly we have \(wsw^{-1}w(C) = ws(C) = v(C)\).
Note that the element \(wsw^{-1}\) is the only element, that flips the edge \(\{w(C), ws(C)\}\).
Thus, the map \(W \times S \to W, \; (w, s) \mapsto wsw^{-1}\) defines a labeling of the edges by elements in \(W\).
We will call the combinatorial graph of \(G\) (meaning that every double edge gets collapsed) the \emph{chamber graph} Cham\((W, S)\) of \(W\).

It is obvious, that this graph is isomorphic to the combinatorial Cayley graph of the group \(W\) and we see that the Cayley graph `embeds' into the Tits cone \(WC\).
This will be useful to prove the next theorem.

\begin{theorem}
    By doubling in a face of the fundamental chamber and iteratively doubling the resulting chamber, we will at some point cover every chamber in the Tits cone \(WC\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The proof is by induction on the word length \(\ell(w)\).
    For \(\ell(w) = 0\), the corresponding chamber is the fundamental chamber \(C\), which is covered by itself.
    \IH{Chambers with labels \(v\) of length \(\ell(v) = k - 1\) are covered by a polytope \(P = \bigcup_{i=1}^n w_i(C)\).}\par\noindent
    We need to show that chambers of the form \(w(C)\) with \(\ell(w) = k\) can be covered by reflecting in a face of the polytope \(P\).
    Using the chamber graph Cham\((W, S)\), constructed above, we deduce that for each such \(w\), there is a \(v \in W\) of length \(\ell(v) = k - 1\), connected to \(w\) by an edge in Cham\((W, S)\). % , labeled by \(ws_iw^{-1}\) for an \(i \in I\).
    This is due to the fact that the chamber graph is isomorphic to the Cayley graph of  \(W\) and the length function of \(W\) is induced by the Cayley graph.
    But then, the chamber \(w(C)\) is adjacent to the chamber \(v(C)\) and the latter is contained in \(P\) by \textbf{(IH)}.
    Thus, either \(w(C)\) itself is already contained in \(P\) or we reflect in the face shared by \(w(C)\) and \(v(C)\) to cover \(w(C)\) with the double \(P'\) of \(P\).
    Now, continuing with the next element \(w\) of length \(k\), we eventually double \(P'\) and repeat this for all such \(w\).
    This iterative doubling process is valid by \Cref{prop:double} and by induction every chamber \(g(C)\) for \(g \in W\) can be covered.
\end{proof}
