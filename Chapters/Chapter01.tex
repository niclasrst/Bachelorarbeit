The theory of \(3\)-dimensional manifolds is far richer and much more complex than that of the more familiar \(2\)-dimensional case of surfaces.
While a significant milestone was achieved in \(2002\) with the completion of the \(3\)-manifold classification by Grigori Perelman, many questions about their more detailed structure remain open.
In his work on \(3\)-manifolds, kleinian groups and hyperbolic manifolds \cite{Thurston1982}, Thurston proposed \(24\) open questions that could guide future research in this area.
In his paper \cite{ian_criteria_2008}, Ian Agol tackled question \(18\) of Thurston, namely whether every hyperbolic \(3\)-manifold virtually fibers, i.e. has a finite-sheeted cover that fibers over \(S^1\).
Many authors gave reason to hope for a positive answer to this question, indeed Thurston himself wrote that `this dubious-sounding question seems to have a definite chance for a positive answer'.
Since the proposal of this question, many \(3\)-manifolds have been shown to virtually fiber but only few criteria for when a manifold virtually fibers were established.
In many cases, the cover that fibers over \(S^1\) was exhibited fairly explicit, for example in Walsh's work on two-bridge knots, Montesinos knots and link complements \cite{Walsh2004}.

With this context, we want to allude to what this work is about and how it relates to the theory of \(3\)-manifolds.
We will be interested in one theorem in Agol's work \cite[Criteria for virtual fibering]{ian_criteria_2008}, stating that every right-angled Coxeter group virtually is residually finite and rationally solvable (RFRS).

As some sort of guidance for the reader, we want to outline the ideas of the sections in Chapter 3 in the following.
First, we introduce the RFRS property on groups, which was found by Agol. % in his work.
In what follows, we will discuss what we have to show to verify this property for a group \(G\).

\noindent
Building onto the developed understanding of the RFRS property, clearly, we want to proceed by finding a candidate for the finite index subgroup \(W'\) of \(W\) that will satisfy the RFRS condition.
This candidate will induce a manifold cover of the fundamental chamber \(C\), corresponding to \(W\) and will be introduced in Section \(3.2\).

\noindent
Continuing from there on, the general goal is to translate from a cofinal sequence of manifold covers of the fundamental chamber \(C\), to a sequence of groups.
To achieve this, there is no way around some orbifold theory, as the fundamental chamber \(C\) carries a natural orbifold structure.
Thus, Section \(3.3\) will cover some aspects of the theory of orbifolds.

\noindent
In Section \(3.4\) we will use the developed tools of the theory of orbifolds, to construct a cofinal sequence of orbifold covers, beginning in the fundamental chamber \(C\).
This sequence will in particular induce a cofinal sequence of subgroups, which we want to be a sequence of subgroups of the finite index subgroup \(W'\).

\noindent
This will be dealt with in Section \(3.5\), where the aforementioned sequence will somewhat be forced to be a sequence of subgroups in \(W'\).
We will see that this new cofinal sequence of groups induces a sequence of manifold covers, starting in the cover established in Section \(3.2\).

\noindent
Up to then, we will have produced a cofinal sequence of subgroups living in \(W'\) and it remains to show that the rationally derived subgroup at step \(i\), is a subgroup of the following subgroup at step \(i+1\).
This will be the content of the last Section \(3.6\), where we will watch loops bouncing off the faces in an orbifold.
We will see `how' specifically loops behave in the orbifolds, given by polytopes \(P_i\), which will then allow us to deduce the main theorem.
