As some sort of guidance for the reader, we want to outline the ideas of the next sections in the following.
Clearly, we want to start by finding a candidate for the finite index subgroup \(W'\) of \(W\) that will satisfy the RFRS condition.
This candidate will induce a manifold cover of the fundamental chamber \(C\), corresponding to \(W\) and will be introduced in Section \(3.2\).

\noindent
Continuing from there on, the general goal is to translate from a cofinal sequence of manifold covers of the fundamental chamber \(C\), to a sequence of groups.
To achieve this, there is no way around some orbifold theory, as the fundamental chamber \(C\) carries a natural orbifold structure.
Thus, Section \(3.3\) will cover some aspects of the theory of orbifolds.

\noindent
In Section \(3.4\) we will use the developed tools of the theory of orbifolds, to construct a cofinal sequence of orbifold covers, beginning in the fundamental chamber \(C\).
This sequence will in particular induce a cofinal sequence of subgroups, which we want to be a sequence of subgroups of the finite index subgroup \(W'\).

\noindent
This will be dealt with in Section \(3.5\), where the aforementioned sequence will somewhat be forced to be a sequence of subgroups in \(W'\).
We will see that this new cofinal sequence of groups induces a sequence of manifold covers, starting in the cover established in Section \(3.2\).

\noindent
Up to then, we will have produced a cofinal sequence of subgroups living in \(W'\) and it remains to show that the rationally derived subgroup at step \(i\), is a subgroup of the following subgroup at step \(i+1\).
This will be the content of the last Section \(3.6\), where we will watch loops bouncing off the faces in an orbifold.
